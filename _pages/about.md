Hi! I am a PhD student researcher at the [School of Computing & Augmented Intelligence, Arizona State University](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/), where I am advised by [Lindsay Sanneman](https://www.lindsaysanneman.com) and associated with the HEART AI Lab.

My research is grounded in AI Reasoning, Planning, and Sequential Decision-Making frameworks. I investigate the performance of generative AI models at various reasoning tasks for sequential decision-making, explore how benchmarks assess relevant constructs, and design agentic frameworks that are reliable and trustworthy.
My research interests also span Human-AI interaction, exploring how humans can augment AI with guidance via {domain & commonsense} knowledge, preferences, intuition, etc. And how AI can assist humans by offering data, compute, {narrow & broad} intelligence capabilities. I also have a broader interest in AI governance and policy. 

Before PhD, in what now feels like a previous life, I worked in Sensor Fusion, Analytics, and Networks across Nokia Networks, Forus Health, and WIPRO Ltd. I also worked as a Software Engineer at Accenture and as a Consulting Resource Person at the Board of IT Education Standards, Bengaluru. I explored research in Information Theory and Network Coding at Texas A&M University, College Station, as a Graduate Merit Scholar in the Computer Engineering Systems Group. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Telecommunication Engineering at PES University, Bengaluru.

In my free time, I enjoy trekking and biking. I have trekked in the Himalayas twice. I also listen to a wide variety of music and soundtracks and dabble in amateur video scoring. I used to be a district-level cricket player in my teens, and follow sporting events around the world.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting
