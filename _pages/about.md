Hello! I am a PhD student researcher at the [School of Computing & Augmented Intelligence, Arizona State University](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/), where I am advised by [Lindsay Sanneman](https://www.lindsaysanneman.com) and associated with the HEART AI Lab.

🔬 In my research, **I investigate the performance of generative AI models at various reasoning tasks for sequential decision-making, explore how benchmarks assess relevant constructs, and design agentic frameworks that are reliable and trustworthy.** My work is grounded in AI Reasoning, Planning, and Sequential Decision-Making frameworks. Take a look at my recent works [here](https://abm120.github.io/publications/).

🤖 My research interests also span Human-AI Interaction & AI Alignment, exploring how humans can augment & align AI with guidance via {domain & commonsense} knowledge, preferences, intuition, etc. And how AI can assist humans by offering data, compute, {narrow & broad} intelligence capabilities. I also have a broader interest in Agentic AI Systems & Applications.

Before PhD, in what now feels like a previous life, I explored research in Information Theory and Network Coding at [Texas A&M University, College Station](https://www.tamu.edu/), as a Graduate Merit Scholar in the [Computer Engineering Systems Group](https://cesg.tamu.edu/). Prior to that, I worked in Sensor Fusion, Analytics, and Networks across Nokia Networks, Forus Health, and WIPRO Ltd. I also worked as a Software Engineer at Accenture and as a Consulting Resource Person at the Board of IT Education Standards, Bengaluru. I obtained my Bachelor's degree with a major in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering at [PES Institute of Technology](https://pes.edu/), Bengaluru, where my capstone thesis, _'U-Sonic NFC: Ultrasonic Near-Field Communication'_, was advised by Dr. Ramamoorthy Srinath ('U-Sonic NFC' was the first ultrasonic device-to-device data transfer prototype, before [Google Tone Project](https://research.google/blog/tone-an-experimental-chrome-extension-for-instant-sharing-over-audio/)). I consider myself fortunate to have had the exposure and opportunity to work in many different technical fields, and grateful to have met many people!


# Hobbies & Interests
In my free time, I enjoy trekking and biking amongst other things. I have trekked in the Himalayas twice. I also listen to a wide variety of music and soundtracks and dabble in amateur video scoring. I used to be a district-level Cricket player in my teens, and follow sporting events around the world, including Tennis and Formula 1.
