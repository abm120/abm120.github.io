Hi! I am a PhD student researcher at the [School of Computing & Augmented Intelligence, Arizona State University](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/), where I am advised by [Lindsay Sanneman](https://www.lindsaysanneman.com) and associated with the HEART AI Lab.

My research is grounded in AI Reasoning, Planning, and Sequential Decision-Making frameworks. I investigate the performance of generative AI models at various reasoning tasks for sequential decision-making, explore how benchmarks assess relevant constructs, and design agentic frameworks that are reliable and trustworthy.
My research interests also span Human-AI interaction, exploring how humans can augment AI with guidance via {domain & commonsense} knowledge, preferences, intuition, etc. And how AI can assist humans by offering data, compute, {narrow & broad} intelligence capabilities. I also have a broader interest in AI governance and policy. 

Before PhD, in what now feels like a previous life, I worked in Sensor Fusion, Analytics, and Networks across Nokia Networks, Forus Health, and WIPRO Ltd. I also worked as a Software Engineer at Accenture and as a Consulting Resource Person at the Board of IT Education Standards, Bengaluru. I explored research in Information Theory and Network Coding at Texas A&M University, College Station, as a Graduate Merit Scholar in the Computer Engineering Systems Group. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Telecommunication Engineering at PES University, Bengaluru.

In my free time, I enjoy trekking and biking. I have trekked in the Himalayas twice. I also listen to a wide variety of music and soundtracks and dabble in amateur video scoring. I used to be a district-level cricket player in my teens, and follow sporting events around the world.
